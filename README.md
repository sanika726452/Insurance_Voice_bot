# 🎙️ Insurance Voice Bot

### AI-Powered Insurance Assistant using Vector Search (FAISS)

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Insurance Voice Bot** is an AI-powered assistant designed to answer insurance-related queries using semantic search and vector similarity.

Instead of traditional keyword matching, this system uses:

* Sentence embeddings
* FAISS vector database
* Intent-based response retrieval

This allows the bot to understand user queries based on meaning rather than exact words.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Intent Dataset (`data.json`)**

   * Contains tags, patterns (user queries), and responses.
   * Example:

     * Tag: `claim_process`
     * Patterns: "How to claim insurance?"
     * Responses: "To claim insurance, you must..."

2. **Sentence Embedding**

   * Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from SentenceTransformers.
   * Converts text into numerical vectors.

3. **Vector Indexing (FAISS)**

   * All patterns are embedded.
   * Stored in a FAISS similarity index.
   * Enables fast nearest-neighbor search.

4. **Query Handling**

   * User input is converted into embedding.
   * FAISS finds closest matching intent.
   * Returns the corresponding response.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* SentenceTransformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
* JSON-based intent dataset
* Streamlit (if app.py used for UI)
